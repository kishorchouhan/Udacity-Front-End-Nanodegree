/*
 * Programming Quiz: Another Type of Loop (6-8)
 *
 * Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
 * that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
 *  - you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable when you're finished looping
